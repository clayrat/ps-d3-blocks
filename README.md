# purescript-d3-examples

Examples of using [purescript-d3](http://github.com/pelotom/purescript-d3) to make D3 visualizations in PureScript.

### Development

You will need the following pre-requisites installed:

*  [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/)
*  [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
*  [bower](http://bower.io/) (e.g., `npm install -g bower`)
*  [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) (e.g., `npm install -g gulp`)

Once you have these installed you can run the following in a cloned repo:

```
npm install    # install dependencies from package.json
bower update   # install dependencies from bower.json
gulp           # compile, launch a web server hosting the examples, and
               # continuously recompile and reload the page in response
               # to changes
```
